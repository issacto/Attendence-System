# Attendence-System
@author: Issac To Kin Wai



This is a program that helps record attendence during meetings through facial recognition.
Admin could also check the overall number and name of attendees via the gui.
In order to add new members to the system, add member's image into Members_Photo file
Hope you'll find it useful!!<br/>
<br/>
This program imported the facial recognition package "dlib"
```python
import dlib
```
