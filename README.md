# Attendence-System
@author: Issac To Kin Wai



This is a program that helps record attendence during meetings through facial recognition.
Admin could also check the overall number and name of attendees via the gui 
What needs to be done is to add attendees' image into Members_Photo file
Hope you'll find it useful!!
